Project: YACS

Recommendation to YACS website design:
1. Make the search bar more stand out, the current design is a bit hard to find on first sight, maybe bold the title?

2. Add class time to the individual classes in the class display section under the course search, the current design lake the information and make 
   deciding class hard.
   
3. Show whether or not a class block is a test block on the Displaying Schedule section, with this feature students can arrange their schedule more
   easily if they don'y need to reserve time for that class block every week.
