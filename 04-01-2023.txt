Possible soultions to displaying what day in a week a session of a class belongs

Currently the data is stored in numbers (0 - 6) representing Monday to Sunday

If I want to display the information in day format I need to figure out how to convert initial

Possible solutions:

write a function to convert the information

sudo code:

std::string convert_day(int number){
    array[7] weekday = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday};

    return array[number];
}

need to figure out how to do it in vue or attach it to vue
